# Helsinki Makers Tour 2016

Tervetuloa! Here you'll find information about the Sigfox tour in Helsinki. We'll help you get started with understanding how Sigfox works, get your Dev Kits setup and provide you with the ideas to get started building your own projects.

### Presentation

You can find the Makers Tour presentation [here](../presentation/2016). This covers everything we've spoken about, examples of sigfox use cases and gives you the chance to follow along with what we're talking about!

### Development Kits

The Development Kit we are using for this event is the [Hidnseek](https://www.hidnseek.fr/). You can find out more by visiting their website or checking out the libraries/board details below.

* [Setup](../devkits/hidnseek)
* [Library](../devkits/hidnseek)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/hidnseek)

### Getting Started

#### Setting Up Your Sigfox Account

To get started you'll need the ID and PAC number associated with your Dev Kit. You should have received this in an email from 'devrelations@sigfox.com'.

Once you have these, head to the Sigfox [activate](backend.sigfox.com/activate) platform. Select '' for your dev kit type and 'ConnectedFinland' for your country/region.

You'll then be asked to enter the ID and PAC of the device that you were given earlier. Enter these and create your account (email address, company, etc.).

You should receive an email from Sigfox asking you to verify you account. Click the link and accept the terms & conditions to start using the platform.

Congratulations! You're all ready to go! Now lets get you sending your first message...!

#### Sending Your First Message

To send your first message you'll need to make sure you've set up the correct development enviroment for the device that you are using. In this case make sure you've visited the [setup](../devkits/hidnseek) instructions for the HidnSeek.

After you've done this, you'll be able to send your first Sigfox message using the code example ['Helloworld'](../devkits/hidnseek). Once you've managed to get this working, feel free to try out one of the other examples, generate your own code or try to grab some sensor data from the device.
