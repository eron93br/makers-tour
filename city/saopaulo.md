# Sigfox Makers Tour São Paulo

Here you'll find information about the Sigfox Makers Tour in São Paulo.  
We'll help you get started with understanding how Sigfox works, get your Dev Kits setup and provide you with the ideas to get started building your own projects.

### Slides & support material



* [Sigfox presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/nicolsc-slides/sigfox-makers-tour-so-paulo)
* [XKit Workshop](https://www.slideshare.net/nicolsc-slides/sigfox-xkit-workshop)

### Development Kits

The Development Kit we are using for this event is the [Thinxtra Xkit](//www.thinxtra.com/xkit/).
This kit is an [Arduino](//arduino.cc) shield with a Sigfox-ready [Wisol](https://partners.sigfox.com/products/wssfm10r2) module


### Getting Started

#### Setting Up Your Sigfox Account

To get started you'll need the ID and PAC number associated with your Dev Kit. You should have received this in an email from 'devrelations@sigfox.com'.

Once you have these, head to the Sigfox [activate](//backend.sigfox.com/activate) platform.  
Select `Thinxtra` as your dev kit provider and `Sigfox France` as your Sigfox operator. `WND Brasil` is not available yet on the platform, but don't worry : there is no roaming issues on the Sigfox network, your device will work exactly the same way.

You should receive an automated email from Sigfox asking you to verify you account. Click the link and accept the terms & conditions to start using the platform.

Congratulations! You're all ready to go! Now let's get you sending your first message...!
