# Sigfox Makers Tour
Welcome to the Sigfox Makers Tour! If this is your first makers tour, you'll be excited to know that we post all of our resources for each event in this repository. You'll be able to easily find the slides for our workshop, libraries and getting started guides for the dev kits we bring along and even some challenges for you to complete!

As the first network truly dedicated to the IoT, Sigfox leads to millions of applications that can change the world; from agriculture to smart metering, to alerting systems and connected fire hydrants. To get people started with the technology, the Sigfox team is organising makers tours all across Europe.

The team will present the network, its underlying technology and run demos & hands-on sessions with dev kits. The workshops will enable you to start your own Sigfox projects. These workshops are specifically aimed at Makers, IoT startups, developers and tech lovers.

If you build a cool project with anything you've learnt from the event, please share it with us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sigfox)! We might even send you some cool swag! ðŸ˜‰
